 This project gives an overview of the various machine learning algorithms implemented to predict rental price of an apartment based on different features that a rental offer has. Exploratory data analysis was performed on the dataset in order to take insights from the data. Feature selection and feature extraction was performed using different machine learning algorithms with the help of Scikit-learn package, and various machine learning models was used to build supervised learning regression, that provided a root mean squared error of 149.33 on the test dataset, which is an acceptable amount of error according to the rental price range.
