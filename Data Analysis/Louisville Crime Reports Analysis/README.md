# Results
The most important and valuables conclusions that gathered during the processes which were discussed in the report, are listed as follows:
- Attempt completion has a stable rate during months and years in this dataset and majority of attempts are completed. Attempts that are not completed are mostly related to theft and considered as PART I in UCR hierarchy.
- There is no especial increasing or decreasing trend in rate of crime occurrence over this five years period.
- Incidents are most likely to occur at afternoon (between 12pm till midnight).
- Some increasing and decreasing trend in rate of crime occurrence are observed in different address blocks and zip codes in previous sections.
- Majority of incidents in the dataset are located in zip codes between 40200 and 40300.
- Difference time between itsâ€™ occurrence and report is dependent on crime type, day range, and zip code. Usually, incidents that occurred at prenoon are reported later than incidents that occurred at afternoon. The range of this time is become more narrower over time in this five years period (relation between this subject and crime type is discussed on Figure 31).
- Majority of incidents are occurred at the middle months. To be specific, at 5th and 7th months, incidents are most likely to occur whilst 2nd month has the least total number of incidents.
- Top crime types, LMPD division, UOR, block addresses, and premise types are clarified and announced in previous sections.
