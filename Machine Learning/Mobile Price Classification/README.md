# Overview
This project gives an overview of the various machine learning algorithms implemented to classify price range of a mobile device based on different features that a mobile has. Exploratory data analysis was performed on the dataset in order to take insights from the data. Feature selection and feature extraction was performed using different machine learning algorithms with the help of Scikit-learn package, and various machine learning models was used to build supervised learning multi-class classifiers, that provided an accuracy of 97% on the test dataset.The dataset was obtained from the popular data science competition portal, Kaggle.

Making predictions is something a business or system depends on, which is indirectly dependant on data analytics. Data analytics is the science of analyzing raw data in order to make conclusions about that information.This analysis can then be used to optimize processes to increase the overall efficiency of a business or system. The dataset here, that I have obtained from Kaggle, is a sample of various types of mobile devices. A new mobile company wants to compete with other big companies, in order to that, they want to know how to estimate price of mobiles their company creates. This project aims to develop a price range prediction model with comparing different popular models and choose the best one that can recognize the patterns in the data.

Tech: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, Dask, Imblearn
