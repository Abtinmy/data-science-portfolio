# Methodology
In this project, I preform different classification methods in order to predict whether an app will be downloaded after clicking on a mobile app advertisement using ‘TalkingData adtracking fraud detection’ dataset. At the end, classification report, ROC curve, and decision boundaries for each classifier will be reported.
