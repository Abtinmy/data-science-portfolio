# Overview
This project gives an overview of the various machine learning algorithms implemented to predict rental price of an apartment based on different features that a rental offer has. Exploratory data analysis was performed on the dataset in order to take insights from the data. Feature selection and feature extraction was performed using different machine learning algorithms with the help of Scikit-learn package, and various machine learning models was used to build supervised learning regression, that provided a root mean squared error of 149.33 on the test dataset, which is an acceptable amount of error according to the rental price range. The dataset was obtained from the popular data science competition portal, Kaggle.

Making predictions is something a business or system depends on, which is indirectly dependant on data analytics. Data analytics is the science of analyzing raw data in order to make conclusions about that information.This analysis can then be used to optimize processes to increase the overall efficiency of a business or system. The dataset here, that I have obtained from Kaggle, is a sample of various types of apartment rental offers. This project aims to develop a price prediction model with comparing different popular models and choose the best one that can recognize the patterns in the data.

Tech: Python, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SciPy, Dask
